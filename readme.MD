# Mini-Projet-Docker: Machine Learning Music Genre Classification

## Overview
This project is part of the **Mini Projet: Nouvelles Architectures** course at ENSIT. It demonstrates the use of Docker to integrate, deploy, and test a Machine Learning environment using Python and Flask. The goal is to classify music genres based on audio features extracted from the [GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).

## Features
1. **Music Genre Classification Services:**
    - **SVM Service:** A Flask-based web service that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify the genre of a WAV file.
    - **VGG19 Service:** A Flask-based web service that leverages the VGG19 neural network to classify the genre of a WAV file.
2. **Frontend Application:** A user-friendly interface to interact with the classification services.
3. **Dockerized Setup:** All components are containerized for seamless orchestration using Docker Compose.
4. **Continuous Integration and Testing:** Jenkins is configured for CI/CD to ensure smooth development and deployment workflows.
